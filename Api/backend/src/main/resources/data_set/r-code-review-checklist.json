The focus of the checklist <em>is not</em> R package development and review; rather, it is aimed at teams of data scientists and/or data analysts who write scripts to generate tables, listings, figures, or any other analytic output.</p><p>The checklist follows principles set forth in <a href=\"https://style.tidyverse.org/\">the tidyverse style guide</a> + <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510\">Good enough practices in scientific computing</a>, and adheres to deodorizing strategies from <a href=\"https://github.com/jennybc/code-smells-and-feels\">Code smells and feels</a>.</p>"
