Extra highlight for first time contribution. Possibly via an Author.md or Contributors.md list on github.\n- A mentorship program, either formal or informal, to help people complete their first contribution.\n- Promote trusted contributors to maintainers with commit access and a chance to maintain the project to a professional standard.</p>"

Nearly 18% of people who're active in open source communities have been faced with a negative interaction with another person. Moreover, 50% of them have been a witness to a negative communication between other people in open source. The most common negative interactions are impoliteness, name calling, and stereotyping. A whopping 21% of users said they stopped contributing to a project because of a negative interaction.</p><p>A project needs to offer a harassment-free experience for all users, regardless of their age, ethnicity, gender, nationality, sexual identity, or religion. In order to foster an open and welcoming environment and avoid negative interactions, post and enforce a Code of Conduct.</p>"
