The scope of this exercise could vary, from generic Azure Landing Zones to workload-specific deployments.</p><p>When doing Azure design reviews (or any review for that matter), Microsoft employees and Microsoft partners often leverage Excel spreadsheets as the medium of choice to document findings and track design improvements and recommendations. A problem with Excel spreadsheets is that they are not easily made subject to revision control. Additionally, team collaboration with branching, issues, pull requests, reviews and others is difficult at best, impossible in most cases.</p>"

The provided <a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/review-checklists/releases/latest/download/review_checklist.xlsm\">Checklist Review Spreadsheet</a> leverages code to interpret JSON from the VBA module in <a href=\"https://github.com/VBA-tools/VBA-JSON/\">https://github.com/VBA-tools/VBA-JSON/</a>, from which there is a copy in this repo to be self-contained (make sure you use the latest version though). The <a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/review-checklists/releases/latest/download/review_checklist.xlsm\">Checklist Review Spreadsheet</a> includes some macros (find the source code both in the spreadsheet as well as <a href=\"./spreadsheet/Sheet1.cls\">here</a>), which are accessible from control buttons in the main sheet.</p><p>Note: the VBA code in the spreadsheet does not work on Excel for Mac, due to some critical missing libraries.</p><p>Additionally, a Github action in this repository translates after every commit the English version of the checklist to additional languages (Japanese, Korean, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese), using the cognitive service <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/translator/\">Azure Translator</a>.
