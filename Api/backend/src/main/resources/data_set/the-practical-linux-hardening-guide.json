It’s up to you to prepare for each eventuality and set up systems to notify you of any suspicious activity in the future.</p><p>The process of hardening servers involves both IT ops. and security teams and require changes to the default configuration according to industry benchmarks.</p><p>Also for me, hardening is the fine art of doing the right things, even if they don't always look to have a big impact. It's always a balance between ease of use and protection.</p><p>You need to harden your system to protect your assets as much as possible. Why is it important?

For me, CIS and the STIGs compliances are about the best prescriptive guides - but of course you can choose a different one (e.g. PCI-DSS, DISA).</p><blockquote>\n<p>Most of all you should use <a href=\"#policy-compliance\">Security Benchmarks/Policies</a> which describe consensus best practices for the secure configuration of target systems.</p>\n</blockquote><p>Configuring your systems in compliance eliminates the most common vulnerabilities. For example, CIS has been shown to eliminate 80-95% of known vulnerabilities.</p><p>On the other hand, these standards are complicated checklists (often for newbies, difficult to implement). In my opinion, ideally, real world implementation is automated via something like OpenSCAP.</p><blockquote>\n<p>You should use a rational approach because more is not better. Each environment is different, so even though security rules should all work in theory, sometimes things will not work as expected.</p>\n</blockquote><p>Hardening is not a simple process.
