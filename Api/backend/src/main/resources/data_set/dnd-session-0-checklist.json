Just because the Wizard player knows the Rogue rolled low for his check for traps, would it make sense for the Wizard character to insist that he check as well?

D&amp;D is a social-based game, you may wish to encourage your players to create characters that play well with others and that will fit with the party.

Does each individual make this decision for themselves? Does religion or government have an effect here? Are some cultures, religions or governments more accepting than others?

How is slavery viewed in your setting by the various cultures in your game? Do only certain races seek to enslave others, or does every race have the potential to take slaves? Perhaps a certain race is a slave race, similar to house-elves in Harry Potter?</p>\n<p>After you have discussed this topics, it maybe best to conclude with a reassuring follow-up. Remind there players that these are being discussed now to avoid player discomfort later on, so that everyone can have a fun game. Remind players that at any time, even if it goes against what you agreed upon, or what was discussed during a Session-0 that they feel uncomfortable, to please say something.</p>"
