Allowing a service to call on other services adds overhead to the request and can result in very slow or unresponsive service. </em></a>  Also it leads to tightly coupled services and a more complex system causing cascading issues. If you see that you need multiple calls back and forth between several services to synthesize the response, you should consider merging these services into one.).

We review designs for entire new systems written by partner developer teams. We review designs for pieces of automation to be developed and run by our own teams. Eventually we may find ourselves using review as a way to keep many teams in sync technically.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most of us however, don't have a systematic way to approach reviews. We read the proposal or attend the meeting, and we look to our experience to try and predict problems. This is valuable, and experience can't be replaced—but I believe we can do better by applying both our expertise and a checklist of things to consider for each design.\"</p>\n</blockquote>"
