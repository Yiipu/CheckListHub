If you are worried about the balance of the game or worried about unfair advantages, use common sense. If the game is single-player, then it doesn't really matter -- the goal is for players to have fun and feel comfortable. If the game is multi-player, either limit the scaling factor to a narrow range, or do not introduce it at all.</p><pre><code>A reasonable way of implementing world scale is by simply scaling the player and related values, rather than scaling the world.\n</code></pre>"
