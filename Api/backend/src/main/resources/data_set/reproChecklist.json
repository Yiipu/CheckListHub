Trusted repositories also assign unique and persistent identifiers. Author maintained websites are not compliant with this requirement.\n- Note: If all data required to reproduce the reported analyses appears in the article text, tables, and figures then it does not also need to be posted to a repository.</p><p><strong>What's the required meta-data</strong></p><p>Any description of data associated with the results that's important for reproducing the analysis and interpretation of the results described in the manuscript, can be considered meta-data, including but not limited to:\n- material type (cells, tissues) and culture/storage conditions\n- material extraction protocol (how was the material obtained)\n- variables (eg. batches) and treatment conditions\n- any other experimental observations that affects the analysis</p>"
